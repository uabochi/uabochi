# 👋 Hi, I'm Uchechukwu Abochi

*Tech Enthusiast | Software Developer*

Welcome to my GitHub space. I'm someone who enjoys learning new things, building real-world solutions, and making sense of how systems work under the hood. My focus lies in crafting simple, effective applications — from web to mobile — and constantly improving with every project I touch. Whether it's through internships, personal builds, or technical programs, I work to turn ideas into working software that solves real problems.

## 🚀 What I Do

### 🖥 Software & Mobile App Development

I write software that is clean, structured, and aligned with user needs. My tools and experience cover:
- **Java** for building Android apps and backend logic
- **JavaScript** for dynamic client-side interactivity
- RESTful API development and integration
- Database management with **SQL** and **NoSQL**
- Basic cloud deployment using **DigitalOcean**

### 🌐 Web Projects

I build websites that not only function well but also communicate clearly:
- Frontend layouts with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Clean, responsive designs that work on all devices
- Backend APIs that connect things smoothly

### 🎓 Knowledge Sharing

Beyond building apps, I enjoy teaching and simplifying tech for others:
- Class teaching experience in Maths and Science
- Passionate about breaking down tech concepts for beginners
- Always learning, always ready to guide
